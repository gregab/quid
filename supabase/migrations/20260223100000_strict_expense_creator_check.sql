-- Migration: Remove NULL createdById backward-compatibility fallback
--
-- The previous migration (20260223000000) allowed editing/deleting expenses with
-- NULL createdById (created before the field was populated). This was intended as
-- backward compat but effectively let any group member edit/delete any old expense.
--
-- Fix: remove the IS NOT NULL guard so that NULL createdById (unknown creator)
-- is treated as "not you", blocking any member from editing/deleting it.
